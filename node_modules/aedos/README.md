## What is Aedos?

Aedos is a free nodejs module created primarly to detect profane and immodest words in a text, as an addition it can detect as well languages of a specific text, the module uses Artificial Intelligence in order to detect both the text and the profanity in a text with a list of profane words as a data modal in order to train it.

## How many languages it can detects?

it can detect 62 languages and it will be added new ones soon.

## What's new in this release?

- method to remove profane words from the text
- method to validate the text
- 100 profane word have been added
- bug fixes
- API for this module has been created
- Fluid API

## How to use it?

You can use now the method validate text to be able to validate the text once without the need
to repeat the process after that you can use any of the following methods to manipulate the text as following.

### detect a language in a text

the detection is relative to the length of the text the longer was the text the more detection will be accurate, in case the text was to small (less then 2 words) it will throw an "InputError" with a message.

```javascript
const { validateText } = require("aedos");

// then use it with any async/await function
async function detectLanguages(text) {
  const detectionResult = await validateText(text).detectLanguagesInText();
  return detectionResult;
  // this will return an object like this { data: {"detected-languages": [{language: "en", accurarcy: 1}]}}
}
```

### detect profanity in a text

the detection is based on a statistical matching using some hasing algorithms, the algorithm transform every each charchter in a word into a digit and then calculates the percent of the similarity of the word in a text and the pattern, and then generate the final percent of the matching.

the module can detect the profanity in a text with one language or multiple as following:

#### text with one language

```javascript
const { validateText } = require("aedos");

let text = "f** you mo*** fu*** i will kill you j*, mal***";

// using async/await
async function detectBadWords(text) {
  let result = await validateText(text).detectProfaneWordsInText();
  return result;
  // this will return an object like this
  // { data: {"founded-}word": [f**]}
  // ...
}
```

#### text with mutliple languages

```javascript
const { validateText } = require("aedos");

let text = "you m*** f*** i will k***, راح ا**** يا ق***ة";

// using async/await
async function detectBadWords(text) {
  let result = await validateText(text).detectProfaneWordsInText();
  return result;
  // this will return an object like this
  // { data: {"founded-}word": [f**]}
  // ...
}
```

#### remove profanity in a text

It's new in version 1.1.2 (release) with this method if you want to remove any profane words in a text
and keep your text clean this can be done so easily, this feature can help you provide for your user credibility by comparing between the original text and the moderated text in the result as the following.

```javascript
const { validateText } = require("aedos");

async function removeBadWords(text) {
  const { originalText, moderatedText } = await validateText(
    text
  ).removeProfaneWordsFromText();
  // return you result as your app requires
}
```
